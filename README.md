# domino_scoreboard
A scoreboard for dominoes written in Python using pygame

Based on the original Scratch version, which you can see here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/117540960/ (it's a bit of a mess because I made it mostly **for personal use**)

### This program is being made for my personal use. I'm just sharing my work with the internet. It is not intended to be used seriously.
I will, however, try to make it as good as I can, but I can't 100% guarantee that. Maybe it will be the same mess as the Scratch version. Who knows.
